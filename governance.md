# Governance

All fees and some decisions of the protocol will be handled by our DAO managed by players of the [VeryNifty Gallery NFT game](https://gallery.verynifty.io/).

**Here are a few reasons for this:**

1. The VNFT game requires you to be active daily, we want to support people that are real users of what we do, are exposed to the NFT market, and not users that just spend money to get votes. We want to grow together.

1. We developed the game, being our second project and already well established, it is a great fit for us and in the very unlikely case of any upside, we the developers and our early believers can all be rewarded.

## How does the voting and fee distribution work?

NFT20 earns 5% of every tokenized NFT, 70% of those tokens will go to the DAO that is controlled by VNFT holders based on the current parameters:

1. Must have 90HP and above.
1. NFT must be at least 2 months old.

**Details on the voting weight of each VNFT will be released shortly after launch.**

~~To learn more about the VNFT game please check out this [guide](https://verynifty.medium.com) ~~

VNFT players that meet the above parameters will be able to vote on things like:

1. NFT20 Fee distribution and percentages.
1. Partnership proposals.
1. Feature requests.
1. More usecases will be added as we grow.

The other 30% of fees will be used to incentivize $MUSE-ETH liquidity, so players of the VNFT game are able to grow their NFTs and use them for governance.

## Why no regular DAO like popular in DEFI Jan 2021?

We don't want to play decentralized teather that is so popular now, and we didn't raise money or printed unlimited tokens with cute pumpamentatls to play governance.
**We are active developers bootstraping real products and until our vision is executed, we won't complete an exit to community.**

We understand this is not for most short term speculators, but because we are working without any funding or pre mine, fun is what keep us going and spending hours reading random speculators posts and voting on those, would kill our flow. **We are creators, not speculators.**
