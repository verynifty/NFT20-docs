# Welcome to the NFT20 Docs

Welcome to the NFT20 documentation. NFT20 is a permissionless p2p protocol to tokenize NFTs and make them tradable on decentralized exchanges such as UniSwap or Sushiswap.

Anyone with an NFT can create a new pool or add his NFT to an existing pool and get ERC20 Token derivatives of their NFTs in a permission-less way, those tokens can be transferred and traded on DEXes
right away.

$Muse is the governance token of NFT20 and can be [farmed by providing liquidity to different NFT20 token pairs](https://nft20.io/farm).
